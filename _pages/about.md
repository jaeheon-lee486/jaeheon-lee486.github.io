At [KAIST](http://kaist.ac.kr), I majored in Biology, AI, and Electrical Engineering, building a foundation in computational neuroscience. I'm interested in understanding neural information encoding and cognitive uncertainty — especially in how different pieces of information come together and compose layers of complexity. I've also studied [mathematics](https://velog.io/@jaeheon-lee/series/Math) by watching a [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@enjoyingmath9346) channel. 

I interned in [Min Whan Jung's lab](https://sites.google.com/site/systemsneurolaboratory/) for two months, assisting with rat experiments involving training and surgical procedures. Following that, I spent 1.5 years in [Sang Wan Lee's lab](https://aibrain.kaist.ac.kr/) working on a simple RL project and analyzing error signal propagation in fMRI using MVPA. I also worked as a data scientist and a participant in [Korea's mandatory ITP program](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supplementary_service_in_South_Korea) for two years at [DeepBio](http://deepbio.co.kr), an AI histopathology startup. Currently, I'm part of [Yul HR Kang's lab](https://yulkanglab.org/), focusing on psychophysics and human uncertainty, while also working in [Cristina Savin's lab](https://csavin.wixsite.com/savinlab/research) at NYU on a project related to compositional learning.

I'm planning to apply for a PhD program in the U.S. next year, with the goal of starting in 2026.

Thank you for visiting my GitHub page, where I share my pursuits and discoveries.

Best regards, JaeHeon Lee
