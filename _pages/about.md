At [KAIST](http://kaist.ac.kr), I am pursuing majors in Biology, Artificial Intelligence, and Electronic Engineering. My academic focus is dedicated to an integrated study in these three dynamic fields. My fascination lies in comprehending the intricacies of the brain and seeking mechanisms to shed light on ambiguous concepts in neuroscience like thinking, dreaming, and memory. Recently, I have been particularly captivated by studying [mathematics](https://velog.io/@jaeheon-lee/series/Math).

As a participant in [Korea's mandatory Industrial Technical Personnel program](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supplementary_service_in_South_Korea), I've embraced the opportunity to expand my horizons at [DeepBio](http://deepbio.co.kr), a leading AI histopathology startup. This role, while a shift from my central academic pursuits, has offered me a unique platform to delve into the innovative world of AI applications in medical diagnostics. At DeepBio, I am actively involved in revolutionizing histopathological analysis through cutting-edge AI technologies, an endeavor that complements and enriches my broader scientific interests.

In terms of interpersonal connections, I thrive in fostering meaningful relationships within open networks and engaging with individuals from diverse backgrounds. Building connections and collaborating with like-minded enthusiasts enriches my journey and amplifies the impact of my endeavors.

During my leisure time, I find solace in leisurely walks, exploring uncharted territories that invigorate my mind and foster creativity. The allure of unexplored domains beckons me, driving my passion for understanding the workings of the brain and making neuroscience accessible to all.

Thank you for visiting my Github page, where I share my pursuits and discoveries. Let's embark on this intellectual adventure together, where endless possibilities await exploration.

Best regards, JaeHeon Lee
