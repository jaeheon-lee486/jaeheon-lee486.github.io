At [KAIST](http://kaist.ac.kr), my studies span across Biology, Artificial Intelligence, and Electrical Engineering, forming a multidisciplinary foundation for my deep interest in computational neuroscience. This unique combination of fields guides my quest to unravel the complexities of the brain, including deciphering the mechanisms of neural information encoding and processing, and exploring aspects of cognitive uncertainty. Recently, my academic journey has led me to dive into [mathematics](https://velog.io/@jaeheon-lee/series/Math), further enriching my understanding of the intricate interplay between brain function and computational models.

As a participant in [Korea's mandatory Industrial Technical Personnel program](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supplementary_service_in_South_Korea), I've embraced the opportunity to expand my horizons at [DeepBio](http://deepbio.co.kr), a leading AI histopathology startup. This role, while a shift from my central academic pursuits, has offered me a unique platform to experience the innovative world of AI applications in medical diagnostics. (2022.03-2024.02)

In terms of interpersonal connections, I thrive in fostering meaningful relationships within open networks and engaging with individuals from diverse backgrounds. Building connections and collaborating with like-minded enthusiasts enriches my journey and amplifies the impact of my endeavors.

During my leisure time, I find solace in leisurely walks, exploring uncharted territories that invigorate my mind and foster creativity. The allure of unexplored domains beckons me, driving my passion for understanding the workings of the brain and making neuroscience accessible to all.

Thank you for visiting my GitHub page, where I share my pursuits and discoveries. Let's embark on this intellectual adventure together, where endless possibilities await exploration.

Best regards, JaeHeon Lee
