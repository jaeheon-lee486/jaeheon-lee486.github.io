At [KAIST](http://kaist.ac.kr), where I'm currently in my 4th year, I majored in **Biology, AI, and Electrical Engineering**, building a foundation in computational neuroscience. I'm interested in how recurrent dynamics represent time-dependent information and support memory, while uncertainty modulates inference and decision-making, **contributing to structured forms of complex cognition**. I've also studied [mathematics](https://velog.io/@jaeheon-lee/series/Math) by watching a [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@enjoyingmath9346) channel. 

I interned in [Min Whan Jung's lab](https://sites.google.com/site/systemsneurolaboratory/) for two months, assisting with rat experiments involving training and surgical procedures. Following that, I spent 1.5 years in [Sang Wan Lee's lab](https://aibrain.kaist.ac.kr/) working on a simple RL project and analyzing error signal propagation in fMRI using MVPA. I also worked as a data scientist and a participant in [Korea's mandatory ITP program](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supplementary_service_in_South_Korea) for two years at [DeepBio](http://deepbio.co.kr), an AI histopathology startup. Currently, I'm part of [Yul HR Kang's lab](https://yulkanglab.org/) (since Spring 2024), focusing on psychophysics and human uncertainty, as well as neural posterior estimation and cognitive map formation in computational models. Also, I'm working in [Cristina Savin's lab](https://csavin.wixsite.com/savinlab/research) at NYU (since Fall 2024) on a project related to curriculum learning, investigating how models reuse neural dynamics when performing multiple tasks sequentially.

I'm planning to apply for a PhD program in the U.S. this fall, with the goal of starting in 2026.

Thank you for visiting my GitHub page, where I share my pursuits and discoveries.

Best regards, JaeHeon Lee
