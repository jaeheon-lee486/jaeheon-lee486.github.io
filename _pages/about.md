At [KAIST](http://kaist.ac.kr), I am currently pursuing a double major in biology and computer science, with a keen interest in exploring diverse academic domains. My fascination lies in comprehending the intricacies of the brain and seeking mechanisms to shed light on ambiguous concepts in neuroscience like thinking, dreaming, and memory. Recently, I have been particularly captivated by studying mathematics.

Currently, I'm working with [DeepBio](http://deepbio.co.kr), an AI histopathology startup, where I engage with cutting-edge technologies to revolutionize histopathological analysis. Through this role, I delve into the fascinating world of AI applications in histopathology and contribute to advancing medical diagnostics.

In terms of interpersonal connections, I thrive in fostering meaningful relationships within open networks and engaging with individuals from diverse backgrounds. Building connections and collaborating with like-minded enthusiasts enriches my journey and amplifies the impact of my endeavors.

During my leisure time, I find solace in leisurely walks, exploring uncharted territories that invigorate my mind and foster creativity. The allure of unexplored domains beckons me, driving my passion for understanding the workings of the brain and making neuroscience accessible to all.

Thank you for visiting my GitHub page, where I share my pursuits and discoveries. Let's embark on this intellectual adventure together, where endless possibilities await exploration.

Best regards, JaeHeon Lee
